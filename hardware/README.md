This directory contains the datasheet of the adapter chip.

N.B. that many cheap PCBs that you can buy on Ebay, Amazon, Alibaba and the like have an error that is visible in the cirtuit diagram as well:
They are missing a connection from analog ground to the ground plane (AGND vs. GND). You can check with a multimeter - the GND pin on the digital side should connect with the E-/black pin on the load-cell side. If it does not, simply solder a wire between both pins.
